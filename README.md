  According to mappingpoliceviolence.org, police have killed 1,079 people in the United States in this year alone. Of those 1,079 people, 279 of them were African Americans. When you do the math, African Americans only account for 13% of the population yet they make up a staggering 26% of those who have been killed by police this year. Looking at the history of police killings, African Americans are three times more likely to be killed by police than white people. In 2014, “fewer than 1 in 3 black people killed by police in America were suspected of a violent crime and allegedly armed,” making 69% of the deaths belong to non-violent, unarmed victims. In 2015, 30% of black victims were unarmed and killed at five times the rate of unarmed whites. Additionally, 99% of cases from that year have not resulted in any officer(s) involved being convicted of a crime. These fatal crimes occur all over the country and the issue continues to rise (1).
	 As a result of increasing police brutality and “the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the shooting death of African-American teen Trayvon Martin” in 2013, the #BlackLivesMatter movement began. Black Lives Matter is a movement that “campaigns against violence and systemic racism towards black people” and holds regular protests against police killings (2).
	For my project, I want to focus on the common trend of acquitting police officers who are clearly guilty of the heinous murders against unarmed African Americans. To do so, I am going to focus on the data from 2015 cases where the jury has made the final decision in a large majority of the cases. The website for Mapping Police Violence states “Only 13 of the 104 cases in 2015 where an unarmed black person was killed by police resulted in officer(s) being charged with a crime. 4 of these cases have ended in a mistrial or charges against the officer(s) being dropped and 4 cases are still awaiting trial or have a trial underway. Only 4 cases have resulted in convictions of officers involved, with a fifth case resulting in the officer pleading guilty” (1).
  My game is going to have the user act as the police officer that shoots defenseless, unarmed, slowly moving “African Americans” that will be black objects on the screen. Once they hit the “target,” they are shown the actual legistics of the “life” they just took based on actual victims of police brutality and the jury decision (each time the officer will be acquitted). It is a simple game, but I want the user to be able to see how easy these police officers take the lives of nearly innocent individuals and face no charges or punishment.
